# Enhancing Fraud Detection by Feature Selection Using Flood Metaheuristic Algorithm

### 🚀 Minor Project | B.Tech CSE 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on improving fraud detection systems by applying feature selection through a nature-inspired optimization technique — the **Flood Optimization Algorithm (FOA)**. We evaluate the performance of various classifiers (KNN, SVM, and Random Forest) on a transaction dataset using the **Sphere function** as the fitness evaluator. The goal is to enhance classification accuracy and reduce computational complexity by identifying the most relevant features.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Fraudulent transactions have become increasingly sophisticated, making early detection a critical challenge. Traditional machine learning models often suffer from overfitting and decreased accuracy due to redundant or irrelevant features. This project addresses that issue using **metaheuristic-based feature selection**, specifically with the **Flood Optimization Algorithm**.

## 🧠 Algorithms & Techniques Used

- **Flood Optimization Algorithm (FOA)** for Feature Selection  
- **Sphere Function** as the fitness function  
- Classifiers:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Linear, Polynomial, and RBF kernels (One-vs-One vs One-vs-All strategy analysis)
  - Random Forest

## 📊 Dataset

We used the **Synthetic Fraud Dataset**, which simulates real-world transaction data including both fraudulent and legitimate instances. The dataset was preprocessed for normalization and feature scaling.
